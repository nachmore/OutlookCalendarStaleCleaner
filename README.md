# OutlookCalendarStaleCleaner
Simple tool to clean stale calendar invites sitting in your inbox. This tool will:

  1. Delete unanswered calendar invites if the meeting happened over 24 hours ago
     - Note: meeting will remain on your calendar, just marked as tentative
  2. Delete calendar invites that have already been accepted (perhaps manually on your calendar)
  3. Automatically process meeting cancellations
